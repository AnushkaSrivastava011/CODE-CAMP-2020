# **Overview**

We have enough food to feed 10 billion people but still hunger and malnutrition is a global issue. So much of food is wasted in parties. Food waste is a problem with not much practical and effective solution available. Another problem is of farmers whose hard work can be seen in your bones and blood. In 2012, the National Crime Records Bureau of India reported 13,754 farmer suicides. This is not acceptable. Nearly 70% of India's population is rural whose primary source of livelihood is agriculture, and contributes about 50% of India's GDP. So agriculture is a sector of great importance. Do you have a solution to ensure food security?

# **Example**
